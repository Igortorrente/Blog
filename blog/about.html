<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hi,
</p>

<p>
I'm Igor, a developer who graduated from the University of Campinas(Brazil).
</p>

<p>
And with this blog, I want to share some things that I learned,
discovered, developed.
</p>

<p>
As a developer I like FOSS, and I have some contributions to open source
projects like a Roundcube Nextcloud app, Weston compositor, Linux kernel,
and other minor contributions to other projects.
</p>

<p>
I also like graphics, optimization, Operational systems, and other related
topics. Maybe one day, I will be able to say that I'm a graphics open-source
developer, but today isn't that day. While this does not happen, I'm still
playing with Vulkan.
</p>
